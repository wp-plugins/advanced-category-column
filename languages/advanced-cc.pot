"The Advanced Category Column does, what the Category Column Plugin does; it "
"creates a widget, which you can drag to your sidebar and it will show "
"excerpts of the posts of other categories than showed in the center-column. "
"It just has more options than the the Category Column Plugin. It is tested "
"with WP up to version 3.5 and it might work with versions down to 2.9, but "
"will never be explicitly supported for those. The 'Advanced' means, that you "
"have a couple of more options than in the 'Category Column Plugin'."
